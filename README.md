# TeamGenerator
A Team calculator repo to handle a local team generator for 5 a side outside and indoor football teams

This is currently only a pet project of mine, using some crummy json files as a test bed for storing content

The current future work is thus:
1. Complete docker file
2. Move to SQL Server for hosting
3. Implement a Login/Authentication Mode
4. Split into services and containerize them
5. Look at Event Messaging as well
6. App development (Android)
7. Look at mobile cross development platforms
7.1. React and React Native
